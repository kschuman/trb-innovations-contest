## Competition Objectives
The contest aims to advance the use of data by transit agencies to inform decisions. Using provided data as part of the contest and/or an agencyâ€™s own data, participants are encouraged to develop innovative approaches to analyzing data and communicating results. The contest is also designed to provide a professional development opportunity for young transit agency employees and encourage their participation in TRB.

## Data Description
